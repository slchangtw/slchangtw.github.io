Hey, I'm Shun-Lung Chang, a Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer originally from Taiwan. Through my blog, "Be a Problem Solver," I aim to share insights and accomplishments from my learning journey. My primary focus revolves around honing technical skills, particularly in Python programming and MLOps-related domains. You can also find my learning projects on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/slchangtw).

Additionally, I will also delve into the world of communication skills and soft skills, recognizing their importance in becoming a well-rounded problem solver. Join me on this exploration as I seek innovative solutions to real-world challenges while developing both technical and interpersonal abilities.
